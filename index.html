    <p>Nothing like a good plate of aromatic biryani! This Vegetable Biryani hits all the right spots with its wonderful 
        aroma and exotic flavors! Loaded with veggies, crunchy cashews, warm spices like saffron, herbs like cilantro and mint,
         this biryani is a delight to the taste buds in every bite!</p><p>So, I know that more often that not, vegetable biryani 
        is looked down upon.I have often heard people call it “pulao” and claiming that an actual biryani should have meat 
        in it. While I don’t know how accurate that claim is, I still think that a very good Vegetable Biryani is very much 
        possible which is very different from a pulao. For me pulao is a short cut one-pot meal (like this beetroot pulao) which
         I make when I am in mood for easy dinner. On the other hand, I make biryani for special occasions. It’s a multi-step 
         process, takes time and is not something I would make for a weekday dinner.I can 100% guarantee you that even if you 
         don’t think much of veg biryani, this one will change your mind!</p>
        <p>It’s super flavorful, packed with so many flavors and will entice your taste buds in every bite!
        I won’t say this is an easy or super quick recipe because it’s not.The recipe takes time, there are multiple steps. 
        So reserve this dish for special occasions.It is well worth the effort though, that much I can guarantee</p>

    <h2 style="color:brown">What is Biryani?</h2>
        Biryani is a rice dish made with layers of rice, spices and traditionally meat (but it our case veggies!).

        Here are the <b>key components of biryani</b>:
        
        Rice: of course rice is the base and key ingredient of this dish. Long grain basmati rice is what is traditionally used.
        
        I highly recommend using <b >extra-long grain aged basmati</b> rice for biryani. I use the <i style="color:brown">Zebra Sella Basmati Rice</i> and it works so well.
        
        <dl><dt><b>Veggies:</b></dt> <dd> So traditionally meat is used in biryani but since we are making veg biryani, we are using assorted vegetables here.
        
        I have used potato, cauliflower, beans and carrots.
        
        You can use green peas, mushrooms or even paneer would be a good addition.</dd></dl>
        
        <dl><dt><b>Spices:</b></dt> <dd>: Aromatic and exotic spices  (both whole and ground) are a must for a good biryani. Most commonly used are cardamom, peppercorns, cumin, saffron, garam masala.
         
        Also rose water or kewra water is often used to flavor the biryani.</dd></dl>
        <dl><dt><b>Fresh herbs and nuts:</b></dt> <dd>: herbs like mint, cilantro and nuts like cashews are often added as garnishing and to add more texture and flavors to the biryani.

         Caramelized onions also make a great addition.

         The veggies and rice are layered and the biryani is then cooked on low heat with some heavy object placed on top of the pot of biryani.

         This process is called “dum” and hence it’s also known as <b> Vegetable Dum Biryani</b>.</dd></dl>

         </center><hr>
         <h2 style="color:brown">Can you Make this Vegetable Biryani Vegan?</h2>
Absolutely, super simple!<br>
<ul type="disc">
<li>skip the ghee</li>
<li>replace plain yogurt with non-dairy yogurt (like almond milk yogurt) or with coconut milk</li>
<li>use non-dairy milk to make the saffrom milk</li>
</ul><br><br>

So let’s see how make this vegetable biryani!

<h3>Method:</h3>
Cook the rice

Soak the rice in 3 cups (24 oz) water for 30 minutes.

<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li>Heat a pot full of water, add 3 green cardamom, 2 cloves and 3/4 teaspoon salt to it. Letit come to boil.</li>
    <li>Add rice, stir with a spoon.replace plain yogurt with non-dairy yogurt (like almond milk yogurt) or with coconut milk</li>
    <li>Let it cook uncovered (don’t lower the heat) until it’s almost cooked (around 70-75% cooked but not fully cooked). There should be a bite to it. This takes around 6 to 7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove pan from heat and drain rice in a colander. You may add a teaspoon of ghee to the rice. Set aside.</li>
</ol><br><br>

</center><br>
<b>Caramelize onion & cashews and pan fry the veggies</b>
<ol type="1" start="5">
    <li>Heat 1.5 tablespoons ghee in a pan on medium heat. Once hot, add 1 sliced onion to it and cook until they turn golden brown and caramelize. <br>This takes around 8 to 9 minutes. Remove on a plate.</li>
    <li>To the same pan, now add cashews and cook until golden brown, around 1 to 2 minutes. Remove on plate and set aside.</li>
    <li>To same pan add potato, cook for 2 minutes until light brown. Remove on a plate.</li>
    <li>To the same pan, now add cauliflower, beans and carrots. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes until veggies appear light brown. Remove on a plate.<br><br>PS: This pan-frying veggies is an additional step and you can skip it and directly cook the veggies later on. I like doing the extra step as it gives the veggies a nice texture</li>
    </ol><br><br>

    </center><br>

<b>Make the saffron-milk and cook the vegetables</b>
<ol type="1" start="9">
    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons milk in a pan. Once warm, add saffron strands (crush it before adding).<br>Let it sit for 10 minutes for that beautiful yellow color. Saffron milk is ready, set it aside.</li>
    <li>Crush ginger, garlic and chili using a mortar and pestle. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat 1.5 tablespoons oil in a pan/pot on medium heat. Add cumin seeds, cinnamon stick, bay leaf, peppercorns, remaining 3 cardamom and remaining 2 cloves.<br>Stir and let the spices sizzle for few seconds. Add the sliced onions also add 1/4 teaspoon salt.</li>
    <li> Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until onions turn light brown. Then add the crushed ginger-garlic and green chilies paste.<br><br>Cook for 2 minutes until the raw smell goes away</li>
    </ol><br><br>

    </center><br>
    <ol type="1" start="13">
        <li>Remove pan from heat and whisk in the yogurt, whisking continuously until it’s all absorbed.<br>Put the pan back on heat. Add all the veggies and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the biryani masala and kashmiri red chili powder.</li>
        <li> Add 1/4 cup water. Let it cook for around 6 to 7 minutes until veggies are almost cooked but not overcooked. They should be firm to bite.</li>
        <li>You may also cover the pan, I usually cook uncovered. There shouldn’t be much water left, it should be kind of thick mixture.<br><br>Remove from heat.</li>
        </ol><br><br>
        <center><img src="https://www.cookwithmanali.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Restaurant-Style-Vegetable-Biryani-Recipe-Step-4.jpg" alt="Key components of Biryani" height="600" width="700">
        </center><br>
<b>Layer the Biryani</b>
<ol type="1" start="17">
    <li>Now take a heavy bottom pan. I first grease the bottom of the pan with ghee</li>
    <li>Then add a layer of rice (half of the rice).</li>
    <li>Top with half of fried onion, half of fried cashews and half of cilantro and mint. Add 1/2 teaspoon of rose water.</li>
    <li>Now place the veggies on top (all of it).</li>
    </ol><br><br>
    <center><img src="https://www.cookwithmanali.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Restaurant-Style-Vegetable-Biryani-Recipe-Step-5.jpg" alt="Key components of Biryani" height="600" width="700">
    </center><br>
    <ol type="1" start="21">
        <li>Then add the remaining rice on top of the veggies. Then top it with remaining with fried onion, cashews, cilantro and mint.<br>Add the prepared saffron milk on top.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining 1 teaspoon rose water on top.</li>
        <li>And finally drizzle 1 teaspoon ghee on top. Sprinkle some biryani masala.</li>
        <li>I did 2 layers of rice and 1 layer of veggies. If your pan in small you may do more layers, but the end layer should always be of rice.<br><br> Cover the pan tightly with aluminium foil. Then cover with a fitted lid.
             <br><br>Heat a flat pan on medium heat. Once hot, reduce the flame to lowest. Place your biryani pot on top of the pan and let it cook for 25 to 30 minutes on lowest heat (dum).</li>
        </ol><br><br>

        </center><br>
Scoop out the biryani from the bottom of the pan so that each serving has both the veggies and the rice.<br><br>

Serve vegetable biryani with a side of raita.

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ol type="1", start="1">
   <li>I haven't added lot of vegetables here since I wanted the rice to shine through. You can add more veggies if you like more veggies in your biryani.</li>
   <li>To make the biryani vegan, use vegan yogurt or coconut milk in place of plain yogurt. Skip the ghee and use non-dairy milk to make the saffron milk.</li>
